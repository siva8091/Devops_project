Hi Team,

We have onboarded our application to CyberArk.
The safe name is test-safe.

We now need to retrieve our service account credentials using the CyberArk endpoint during job execution.

Previously, we worked with Deelip from your team, but he is no longer available.

Deelip suggested two approaches:
	1.	Using certificates
	2.	Installing CyberArk agents on our servers

We are trying the certificate-based approach, where we will share our certificate details with your team and you will whitelist them from your end.

At this stage, we are stuck and need your assistance to proceed further.

Could you please share the POC details or next steps so that we can continue working on this?

Thanks in advance for your suppo
