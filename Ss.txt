As discussed, as part of the Sonar upgrade, new rules have been added. This change was already communicated in the non-prod sign-off.

Below is the list of rules that were updatedâ€”please review them.

If you wish to exclude any of these rules from your Sonar scans, please create a custom quality profile and assign it to the relevant projects.

Note: The Sonar scan will run again for both overall code and new code.
