Hi Team,

We have noticed that a manual sync was triggered for your qTest project with Jira.

Could you please let us know the reason for this?

Note: The Jira-qTest integration is event-driven, so a manual sync is typically not required. If you still need to perform a manual sync, please use Jira filters for better control.

For more information on how to use Jira filters, please follow this link: [Provide the link here]
