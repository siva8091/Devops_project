As discussed, we are working with the vendor on a workaround since the current LTS version of qTest has some limitations when updating system fields with large values.

The latest update from the vendor is that they have provided us with DB scripts as a workaround. We are currently testing these in the qTest non-production environment.

We will keep you posted on the progress.
