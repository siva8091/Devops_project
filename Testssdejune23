Check the File/Method Scope

Cognitive Complexity is calculated per method/function, not line-by-line. So even a small change in a method can cause complexity to be re-evaluated for the entire method.

For example, adding a single if inside a method can cause cognitive complexity to go over the threshold, even if most lines are unchanged.
