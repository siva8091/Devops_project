Hi,

As I connected with the team, we’ve updated the quality gate conditions as per your team's request. The builds should now be good.

However, we are still checking how it worked for you earlier with those conditions, as the issue count has remained constant.

Note: We haven’t made any changes from the Sonar platform side.
