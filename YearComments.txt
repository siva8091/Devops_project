Year-End Accomplishment Comments (Simple English)


Clean As You Code Initiative – Simple Summary

I’m working on the VZ Clean As You Code initiative, focusing on standardizing quality gates and profiles. Right now, we’re in the implementation stage and working closely with management to understand the benefits. We’re comparing how projects perform with and without these standards to show the improvement in code quality and reduce issues after deployment.
