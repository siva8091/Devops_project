As we discussed on the call, this is not a Sonar issue. With the inclusion of Git parameters in the MR pipeline, you will get accurate Sonar results.

However, the build is now failing with an npm error. Please check with the responsible team regarding this.

If you need any assistance from the Sonar side, please let us know.
