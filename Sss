Hi Support Team,

We are encountering high web response times for qTest due to qTest API traffic. According to APM data, some requests are taking more than 45 minutes to 1 hour on the DB side, causing high web response times.

Actions we have taken:

Upsized the RDS from 8x large to 14x large, but this did not help.
Redirected all API traffic to a dedicated manager node.
As per the Tricentis Team, we can implement a separate API server like a manager to handle all API traffic. If so, will it support a DB cluster mechanism, where we have multiple nodes under a DB cluster to handle all requests based on a round-robin algorithm? Also, the read replica needs to be part of the DB cluster.

Is there any way to limit or block API requests from the application side?

Please advise.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
