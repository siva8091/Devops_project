We got a response from the support team. Now they are asking us to try the latest version of the sonar-maven-plugin. However, the latest LTS release notes make no mention of any minimum required version for the sonar-maven-plugin related to the Maven Sonar scanner. Over 3,000 services are impacted, and updating the plugin version across all of them would require a huge amount of manual effort. If Sonar had a dependency on a newer plugin version, it should have been clearly documented in the release notes — instead, only JDK updates are mentioned. This is extremely frustrating and unacceptable on their part.
Hi Varsha,

We upgraded Sonar to the latest LTS version, and after the upgrade, we encountered compatibility issues with the sonar-maven-plugin. We raised a support ticket, and the support team has responded. They are now suggesting we try using the latest version of the sonar-maven-plugin.

However, in the latest LTS release notes, there is no mention of any minimum required version for the sonar-maven-plugin when using the Maven Sonar scanner — only JDK-related updates are noted.
This upgrade has impacted over 3,000 services, and updating the plugin version manually will require a lot of effort.

Can you please ask them to arrange a call so we can discuss and reach a conclusion?
