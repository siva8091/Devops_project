We got a response from the support team. Now they are asking us to try the latest version of the sonar-maven-plugin. However, the latest LTS release notes make no mention of any minimum required version for the sonar-maven-plugin related to the Maven Sonar scanner. Over 3,000 services are impacted, and updating the plugin version across all of them would require a huge amount of manual effort. If Sonar had a dependency on a newer plugin version, it should have been clearly documented in the release notes â€” instead, only JDK updates are mentioned. This is extremely frustrating and unacceptable on their part.
