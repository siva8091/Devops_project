Season’s greetings, and hope you’re doing well.

We would like to reconnect to continue the discussion on Sonar MCP. Please share your availability in early January, and we will align calendars accordingly.

As discussed earlier, we would like to review the “Clean as You Code” strategy with a focus on its technical alignment with Verizon engineering standards, including:
	•	Quality gate enforcement at PR/MR level
	•	Incremental and new-code–focused analysis
	•	Measurable reduction of technical debt

In parallel, we have completed an initial technical evaluation of Sonar AI capabilities and would like to discuss potential use cases, architectural considerations, and integration into our IDE and CI/CD workflows.

Looking forward to continuing the discussion and next steps

Season’s greetings, and hope you’re doing well.

We would like to reconnect to continue the discussion on Sonar MCP. Please share your availability in early January, and we will align schedules accordingly.

As discussed earlier, we would like to review the “Clean as You Code” strategy with a focus on its technical alignment with Verizon engineering standards, including:
	•	Enforcement of quality gates at PR/MR level
	•	Incremental code analysis and baseline management
	•	Measurable reduction of technical debt across applications

In addition, we have completed an initial technical evaluation of Sonar AI capabilities, including potential impact on:
	•	Issue detection accuracy and noise reduction
	•	Developer workflow efficiency within IDEs and CI pipelines
	•	Actionability of remediation guidance

We would like to discuss these aspects in detail, along with architectural considerations and recommended adoption patterns.

Happy holidays!

We would like to connect to discuss Sonar MCP. Please let us know your availability in early January, and we will schedule a meeting accordingly.

As discussed earlier, we would like to review the “Clean as You Code” strategy to ensure it aligns with Verizon standards and supports the reduction of technical debt.

Additionally, we have completed some initial research on Sonar AI capabilities and would like to discuss our observations and potential use cases during the session.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks and regards,
[Your Name]
